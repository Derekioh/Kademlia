=================================
Test Cases for the User Interface
=================================

NOTES BEFOREHAND:
      -The User Interface only accepts two maximum arguments.
      -It also only accepts three arguments: EXIT, STORE, and FIND.
      -EXIT can only be entered as one argument.
      -If you want to STORE or FIND, it's required to include a Key/Node ID
       as a second argument.
      -We are assuming the second argument is always an integer.

===============================================

Test Case #1 - Enter three arguments instead of one/two

Input:
>store 1234 4321

Output:
Error: Incorrect Input

-----

Test Case #2 - Enter one argument that is not EXIT

Input:
>notexit

Output:
Error: Incorrect Input

(NOTE: Even inputting "store" and "find" will product the same
       output. Because it is still only one argument)

-----

Test Case #3 - Enter one argument that is EXIT

Input:
>exit

Output:
(program ends so we're back at the terminal prompt)

-----

Test Case #4 - Enter a request for STORE that is successful

Input:
>store 4

Output:
Success!

-----

Test Case #5 - Enter a request for FIND that is successful

Input:
>find 4

Output:
Success!

-----

Test Case #6 - Enter a request for FIND that is unsuccessful

Input:
>find 3

Output:
Failure.
