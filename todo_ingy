This is my personal to do list. If you want/need me to do something you can add it here or if it's a bug you can change my code if it's a small bug. Otherwise You can still add it here.

Todo:

- Write sendmessage in Node + figure out receiver stuff.
- Add Ping response and Findvalue response.
- Update comments in Message.hpp and Message.cpp


Notes:

sendMessage figures out who to send to, creates connection and sends.
But we need to keep track when sending for protocol.
